<li> My BEST FRIEND WANTS to COMMIT SUICIDE!! HOW do I STOP HER!??!?!?!?!?!? </li>
<p> Answer:The first thing I think you should do is tell your parents and have them contact her parents after you make it to her house and are in her presence.  Call other friends and family members and have them meet you there.Once you are there, call the hot line in her presence and tell them that a friend that you love is considering suicide and that you need to know how to tell her that you love her and want her in your life always.</p>

                    <p class="">This is a rough situation. I went through this last year with 2 of my friends up at the exact same time. There's not much you can tell her. You can assure her that you're her friend, that you love her, and that you'll help her in anyway possible, and try to convince her to go to counselling for help. 
However, the BEST thing you can do is tell her parents - I know she'll be angry with you at first and she'll feel betrayed, but in the end she'll end up thanking you for doing it.
Good Luck. :-)

<li>How to get rid of depression?I'm so sick and tired of being depressed but i cant seem to get out of it. I dont know how it would feel to live my life without depression.</li>
  <p> Answer:Depression is like a silent attacker that can attack on your nerves anytime without letting you know that you have become the victim of depression.Do some exercise, listen to some cool music, switch off the lights and enjoy sunlight,take help from animal existence.If you are not allergic of animals and you can get easy access to animal then donâ€™t waste time and spend your time with any animal because the existence of these animals that might be cat or dog makes release a hormone known as oxytocin that is released only when we fall in love, nursing or give birth. This hormone produces goodwill feelings. </p>
